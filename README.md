# ec2-static-website
My first ec2 static website

Overview

Deployed a static website on an AWS EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2) with Apache. Practiced launch, security, file transfer, and Elastic IP for stable public access.

 Steps Taken
1. Launched EC2 (Amazon Linux 2).
2. Installed Apache (`sudo yum install httpd` + start/enable service).
3. Transferred site files via `scp` and set Linux permissions.
4. Opened HTTP (port 80) in Security Groups.
5. Attached an Elastic IP for persistent access. 

 Outcome
- Site accessible publicly via Elastic IP.
- Resolved blank page/permission issues and improved file structure.
